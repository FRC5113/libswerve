Hi!
Welcome to LibSwerve by the combustible lemons
This is still in VERY early alpha and is not suitable for competition use
The API is subject to change
Issues and PR's are welcome!
Feel free to email chaseyalon@gmail.com with questions


Vision:
Create a lightweight framework agnostic zero config way to use swerve. Ideally libswerve would simply detect the hardware and adapt correct hardware and use it.
